# GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION
# ============================================================================
# 
# IMPORTANT: For Render deployment, you MUST set GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON
# in the Render dashboard as an environment variable.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Go to Render Dashboard > Your Service > Environment
# 2. Add new environment variable: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON
# 3. Paste the ENTIRE content of your service account JSON file as the value
#    (including the curly braces, all on one line or with escaped newlines)
#
# Example value (all on one line):
# {"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project","private_key_id":"xxx",...}
#
# Option 1: Path to service account JSON file (local development)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=google_service_account.json

# Option 2: JSON content directly (for production/cloud deployment)
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account","project_id":"...","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."}

# Calendar ID (the Google account that owns/shares the calendar)
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=abdul.dev010@gmail.com

# ============================================================================
# CALENDAR SYNC ENDPOINTS
# ============================================================================
# After deployment, use these endpoints to sync:
#
# POST /calendar/sync-to-calendar  - Push all DB appointments to Google Calendar
# POST /calendar/sync              - Pull calendar changes back to DB
# POST /calendar/full-sync         - Bi-directional sync (both directions)
# GET  /calendar/status            - Check if calendar integration is working
# GET  /calendar/events            - List all calendar events
#
# For automatic sync, set up webhook:
# POST /calendar/setup-watch       - Register webhook for real-time updates

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY NOTE:
# - NEVER commit .env or .env.local files to git
# - Regenerate all API keys before deploying to production
# - Set these as environment variables in Render dashboard
# =============================================================================
